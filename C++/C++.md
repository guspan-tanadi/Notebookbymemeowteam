## New Dynamic Memory Allocation
There are just two keywords in C++
* **new**: dynamic allocation. **Syntax**: `ptr = new data-type(default value)` for single allocation or `ptr = new data-type[size]` for array allocation
* **delete**: dynamic de-allocation. **Syntax**: `delete ptr` for single allocation or `delete[] ptr` for array allocation

## Template

## STL
**Standard Template Library**

## OOP
**Object-Oriented Programming** is the most important feature on C++ different from C
